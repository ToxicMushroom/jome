= jome üòÄ
Philippe Proulx <eepp.ca>

_jome_ is a ‚å®Ô∏è centric emoji picker desktop application.

You can also pick an emoji with the üñ±, don't worry.

jome has most of the interesting emojis of
https://emojipedia.org/emoji-11.0/[Emoji{nbsp}11.0].

I'm not a fan of the usual very broad categories of emojis which do not
intersect so I made my own categories. A given emoji can be found in
more than one category. For example, ü¶à is found in both the _animals (no
faces)_ and _water_ categories. I find that it's easier to visually
search by theme than by very general category. Feel free to suggest more
categories.

jome is currently only tested on üêß.

You need:

* https://cmake.org/[CMake] ‚â• 3.1.0
* A pass:[C++14] compiler
* http://www.boost.org/[Boost] ‚â• 1.58 (only to build)
* Qt 5 (_Widgets_ and _Gui_ component)
* Python 3
** The `cairo` package
** The `cairosvg` package
** The `yaml` package

.Build and install jome
----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
----

[NOTE]
You need to _install_ jome for it to find the correct data files. If you
don't want to install it on your system, use
`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path/to/install/directory` when running `cmake`.


== Usage

jome's purpose is to help you pick an emoji.

When you <<accept-emoji,accept>> an emoji (with the ‚å®Ô∏è or with the üñ±),
jome prints the UTF-8 emoji to the standard output. It can also print
the individual Unicode codepoints.

If you just close the window (you can press **Escape** to do this), jome
prints nothing to the standard output.


=== Interface

image::screenshots/all.png[]

There are four sections:

[[find-box]]Find box (top)::
    Input box where you can type a query to <<find-emojis,find emojis>>.

Emojis::
    All emojis (with an empty find box) or find results.
+
When there's at least one emoji, there's always a selected emoji with a
red box around it.
+
Click an emoji to accept it and quit.
+
Hover an emoji to update the bottom emoji info text temporarily.

Category list::
    List of available categories.
+
When all emojis are shown (the find box is empty), click a category
name to scroll to this emoji category.

Emoji info text (bottom)::
    Name and Unicode codepoints of the selected or hovered emoji.


[[find-emojis]]
=== üîç emojis

The power of jome is its <<find-box,find box>>.

When you launch jome, the find box is focused, and it should stay
focused unless you're browsing emojis manually with the intention of
accepting one with the üñ±.

The format of a query is one of:

* `_TERMS_`
* `_CAT_/`
* `_CAT_/_TERMS_`

where:

`_CAT_`::
    Partial name of categories in which to search.

`_TERMS_`::
    Space-separated list of search terms.
+
For an emoji to be part of the results, at least one of its keywords
must contain _all_ the search terms.


=== Select and accept an emoji

To select an emoji, use the following keys:

‚¨ÖÔ∏è, ‚û°Ô∏è, ‚¨ÜÔ∏è, ‚¨áÔ∏è::
    Go left/right/up/down.

**Page ‚¨ÜÔ∏è**, **Page ‚¨áÔ∏è**::
    Go up/down 10 rows.

**Home**::
    Go to the first emoji.

**End**::
    Go to the last emoji.

[[accept-emoji]]To accept the selected emoji, press **Enter**. Depending
on the <<cl-options,command-line options>>, jome prints the emoji or the
Unicode codepoints to the standard output and quits.


[[cl-options]]
=== Command-line options

`-f`::
    Set the output format:
+
--
`utf-8`::
    UTF-8 emoji.

`cp`::
    Space-separated Unicode codepoints (hexadecimal).
+
Example: `1f645 200d 2642 fe0f`

`ucp`::
    Space-separated Unicode codepoints (hexadecimal) with a `U+`
    prefix.
+
Example: `U+1F93C U+200D U+2642 U+FE0F`
--

`-n`::
    Do not print a newline after printing the emoji or codepoints.


== Type the selected emoji

Here's a Bash script which types, using
https://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/[xdotool], the selected
emoji once jome quits:

[source,bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/bash

codepoints="$(jome -f cp)"

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    exit 1
fi

if [ -z "$codepoints" ]; then
    exit 1
fi

xdotool_args=""

for cp in $codepoints; do
    xdotool_args="$xdotool_args U$cp"
done

xdotool key --delay 50 $xdotool_args
